SHG FROG
Grid size is 256
Starting with Projections
Data in XXXX had 115 taus and 768 w's
Data read in assuming constant wavelength
The experimental time increment is 4.46838 fs.
The expermental data is on a 0.0795457 nm spacing.
The center wavelength was 400 nm.
The FFT requires data on a 0.466239 nm spacing.
This means that there are -5.86127 too many data points.

Trace fractionally shifted to center 70.6475.
The value of tau0 was 71
Max of ZOFM was at 66.
0 0.274351
1 0.264072
2 0.256161

The best error achieved was 0.256161.
